<p>Although I have many, one of my interests within software engineering is front-end web development. I like the idea of designing a user interface and bringing it to life. It’s a good mix of creativity and logic that I enjoy. My goal is to keep learning more and more and eventually be able to complete projects for actual clients. I am considering doing freelance work in the future, so it’s also important to work on my soft skills and people skills as well. In addition to front-end development, I plan on getting my feet wet in back-end development. If I end up enjoying this too, I could even look at being a full-stack developer! Web development in general seems like a great place for me to grow in the software engineering industry.</p>

<p>As an avid Amazon shopper, I have been using a tool called Honey to track prices of products. Since then, I’ve wanted to learn how web scraping works. I started with using BeautifulSoup to scrape static web pages, then moved to Selenium for more complex and automated projects. For instance, tracking flight prices and exporting them to a spreadsheet for data analysis. I would like to continue learning different tools for web scraping, as there are many out there and I want to diversify my toolkit.</p>

<p>As I was getting ready to study computer science in university, I ultimately decided to get a macbook. I might as well try iOS development while I have a macbook right? As it turns out, it’s actually a lot of fun. I am not sure how viable it is as a job in the current state of tech, but I would even do iOS development in my free time. The idea of having an app on the App Store just seems so exciting, and there’s a lot of room for creativity here as well. Ideally, I would like to get more comfortable using Xcode and progressively make more complex applications.</p>

<p>I feel that software engineering is much too broad of a field to single in on one passion or interest. In my opinion, it is hard to decide on what I like or dislike if I don’t have enough diverse experience in the field. My hope is that eventually, I’ll find what I am most passionate about and pursue that as a career. I’m going to be working for most of my life, so I would like to enjoy what I do for work as much as possible. However, I still would like to keep learning new things to keep myself engaged and up to date with the current trends.</p>
