## The Inspiration
After using an open-source anime viewer named <a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli">ani-cli</a>, I wanted to make something similar for reading manga. Furthermore, I wanted something that could be a native application, rather than a website. Thus, I created a macOS native manga reader built in Swift. I did not want to have to worry about advertisements or anything of that sort.

## The Backend
The manga database powering the app is from <a href="https://mangadex.org/">MangaDex</a>. Through their API, I am able to create the manga reading experience that I would have wanted, in a native desktop application.

## Limitations and Future Work
The biggest limitation for this project, and the reason it will not be published, is ultimately the inconsistencies in the MangaDex database. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to create my own database of so much manga altogether, and MangaDex is typically missing chapters. Thus, I cannot create a complete experience for the user. That said, if this problem were to be solved in the future by myself or someone else, I would like to create a more cohesive and pleasing user interface.
